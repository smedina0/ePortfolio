        <h4>Course Description</h4>
        <p>
          This course is an introduction to the emerging multidisciplinary field of Disability
          Studies. Students will engage disability in a variety of sociopolitical and cultural
          contexts, including their own personal values and beliefs as they relate to
          disability and society.
          <br>
          </br>
          Students will be introduced to Disability Studies theory, vocabulary and the
          models that frame disability discourse. Students will examine Disability Studies
          as it emerged from the Disability Rights Movement, explore disability in art and
          literature, investigate and critique current systems of care as they relate to
          self-determination and inclusion, analyze the role of poverty and work, explore
          disability as it intersects with race and gender, and learn about disability in a
          global context.
        </p>
        <h4>Program Goals & Assignments</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Analyze disability experience, both individual and societal, using a multidisciplinary approach.</li>
          <li>Critique representations and expression of disability in the media, creative arts, and culture.</li>
          <li>Theoretical models of disability and how each model shapes society’s response in terms of treatment and systems of care.</li>

        <h4>Course Description</h4>
        <p>
          This course focuses on issues related to embodiment and the biological and medical aspects of
          disability. Students who complete the course will be knowledgeable about: the relationship
          between Disability Studies, medical sociology and the concept of the “lived body;” the difference
          between an understanding of the disabled body as a social construction and as a medical problem;
          the health care needs and experiences of people with disabilities; public policies related to the
          access of people with disabilities to quality health care; identification, prevalence, clinical
          manifestations, cognitive, behavioral and social implications and interventions associated with
          genetic causes of disabilities and acquired disabilities due to traumatic events; the relationship of
          Disability Studies and bioethics in areas such as prenatal testing, the genome project and assisted
          suicide; the value and possibilities of non-verbal communication and sign language to improve the
          quality of life of people with sensory disabilities; language development and educational options
          for children with cochlear implants; modes of communication with individuals with hearing
          impairments and other sensory disabilities; advances in our understanding of issues related to the
          sexual life of people with disabilities; the value of universal design and the physical accessibility of the built environment to people with disabilities and the broader community; and the potential
          for assistive technologies to improve the quality of life of persons with impairments and
          disabilities.
        </p>
        <h4>Program Goals & Assignments</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Explore and articulate the difference between an understanding of the disabled body as a social construction, as a medical problem, and as a lived experience.</li>
          <li>Understand and analyze public policies related to disabled bodies, the variety of embodied experiences of disability, the relationship of disability studies to bioethics, embodied communication, intersectionality, and disabled sexuality.</li>
          <li>Identify, analyze, and critique problems in accommodation and assistance, universal design, and communication access.</li>
          <li>Describe the impact and implications on embodiment on disability studies as a field.</li>
          <li>Demonstrate progressive facility in critical reading, comparison and analysis.</li>
          <li>Build confidence and skill in responding to discussion questions.</li>
        </ul>
        <br></br>
        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>
          This course was eye opening as it provided me with a deeper understanding of how disability is shaped by a combination of social constructs, bodies, minds, and lived experiences. I thoroughly enjoyed materials and discussions regarding the &quot;lived body&quot; and how we connected theory to the real world experiences of people with disabilities. It was also interesting to learn about how assistive technologies and communication strategies could increase the quality of life for individuals with sensory disabilities.

        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>
          This course gave me a a detailed understanding of how to apply the different models of disability studies in various real-world settings among different demographics of people.

        <h4>Course Description</h4>
        <p>
          This course provides an overview of qualitative research methods in the field of disability studies, including ethnography, in-depth interviewing, the use of personal narratives, public documents, material objects, visual and content analysis, and participatory community-based, as well as emancipatory, research. The class focuses on both the practical techniques of qualitative research methodology and current theoretical approaches to the study of disability including critical disability studies and intersectionality. Students will be introduced to qualitative data analysis as well.  The application of these research methodologies to the disability community will be illustrated throughout the course.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          This course is an advanced course. Students are expected to have gained basic disability studies concepts and theories as well as disability history, culture, politics, and activism in courses taken prior to this one. The course is developed to inform students about research methods and to assist students in transitioning to capstone programs. The course is not intended as a “how to” guide to developing a research proposal. Rather, students are invited to consider, critically engage, extend, and expand upon a range of possibilities for research in disability studies.
        </p>
        <h4>Program Goals & Assignments</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Contrast and compare quantitative and qualitative research methodologies and describe research scenarios where each would be appropriate.</li>
          <li>Discuss various methodologies commonly utilized to conduct qualitative research in disability studies and describe various theoretical frameworks used in disability studies.</li>
          <li>Discuss specific methods used in interpretive studies of disability including content, discursive, and visual analysis as well as different analytical models of disability such as the social model, rehabilitative model, etc.</li>
          <li>Develop a basic understanding of critical disability studies and intersectionality.</li>
          <li>Contrast and compare several qualitative research studies.</li>
          <li>Discuss the ethics of studying with specific communities of people and the special protections required when studying vulnerable populations.</li>
          <li>Describe situations where approval is needed from the Institutional Review Board and the steps to secure IRB approval.</li>
          <li>Describe your experience in practicing various qualitative research methods and what you learned.</li>
          <li>Utilize participant observation and write field notes describing it.</li>
          <li>Describe the benefits of reflexive journaling while conducting research and issues around the biases we bring to the research.</li>
          <li>Conduct interviews with individuals and code them for content.</li>
          <li>Analyze the results of participant observation and interview research.</li>
          <li>Develop a structured questionnaire.</li>
          <li>Describe issues related to writing about research.</li>
          <li>Describe an area for investigation and develop a research question that addresses it.</li>
          <li>Conduct a literature review and identify gaps in research.</li>
          <li>Formulate a research proposal and present it to peers.</li>
        </ul>
        <br></br>
        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>
          I found this course to be a valuable exploration of research methods in general but also how they may apply in the specific field of disability studies. I learned of many different research methodologies I had previously never knew of, such as:
          <ul>
            <li>Ethnography</li>
            <li>Participant Observation</li>
            <li>Interview Analysis</li>
          </ul>
          I also appreciate the emphasis on ethical research because it feels as though many people attempt to implement unethical practices, especially when they hope to work with people with disabilities as part of their research.

        <h4>Course Description</h4>
        <p>
          This course will examine the rights and protections afforded to people with disabilities in different arenas. By studying a brief history
          of the disability rights movement and the structure of the American legal system, you will gain an understanding of some of the
          federal laws which have made discrimination against people with disabilities illegal. This course will primarily focus on those
          protections in the areas of employment, public accommodations, federally funded programs, and education. The key laws we will
          study this semester include: (1) Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; (2) the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA); and
          (3) the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). You will learn how these laws were created and what they purport to do,
          how the United States Supreme Court has interpreted these laws, and how these laws are being enforced in our communities. We will
          also spend a class discussing international law, specifically the ADA’s influence on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of
          Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD). Most importantly, you will learn how to apply these laws in order to spot disability rights
          issues in your communities and learn more about advocacy in these areas.
        </p>
        <h4>Program Goals & Assignments</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Apply critical thinking skills to examine issues related to disability policy and law.</li>
          <li>Advocate for improved quality of life and social justice for people with disabilities.</li>
        </ul>

        <br></br>
        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>
          This course provided a comprehensive layout of materials and discussions that ultimately helped me to understand the legal protections of people with disabilities and how those lawas have shaped accessibility and equity. I really enjoyed learning about how to interpret the ADA, section 504, and how the Supreme Court descisions have influenced their implementation. I feel more confident in identifying legal violations and discussion rationale for why certain laws have been put in place.

        <h4>Course Description</h4>
        <p>
          This course will provide an introduction to disability studies and the humanities. Over the last 25
          years disability scholars have analyzed representations of people with disabilities as they appear
          in literature, myth, art, film, photography, dance, and theater. These fields reflect and shape the
          meaning and reality of disability. Poetic and other artistic modes of discourse can deepen our
          understanding of the lived experience of disability. However, these shared representations of
          disability are, for the most part, them for granted. Yet they have a powerful effect on the popular
          culture and the attitudes and behaviors of individuals.
        </p>
        <h4>Program Goals & Assignments</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Knowledge of Disability Experience, Individual or Societal</li>
          <li>Dedication to Improvement of Quality of Life for Individuals with Disabilities</li>
        </ul>
        <br></br>
        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>
          This course improved my understanding of how disability is represented and interpreted in various kinds of mediums. Engaging with all of these texts have given us insight into the symbolic roles disability has been assigned such as punishment or inspiration and how these portrays may shape public perception. I think it was important that we learned to apply disability studies theory to art/literature so that we could move beyong surface-level critiques and recognize the societal impact that these narratives have on people with disabilities. I feel more equipped to talk about and analyze different works through a disability studies lens.

          This course opened me up to topics I had never previosuly considered. Never in my life have I thought about how to be an effective leader in comunity based organizations. This course gave me that knowledge as it relates to organizations focusing on serving people with disabilities. I learned so much detail about upper administration and how leaders must navigate these organizations and even how to improve organizational performance, staff development, and strategic planning. I hope to one day take on a managerial/administrative role in an accessibility based organization, so the values and tactics taught in this class will greatly benefit me as I become an advocate and leader.

        <p>
          This course provides an overview of dis/ability within education. We will foreground historical,
          social, cultural and interpretive understandings of dis/ability, contrasting them with the medical,
          scientific, and psychological understandings of dis/ability within the context of schooling
          practices. Using personal narratives, media representations, contemporary research, historical
          accounts, legal and policy issues, we will analyze competing claims of what dis/ability is. By
          analyzing multiple and interdisciplinary understandings of dis/ability from a wide variety of
          sources, we are able to deepen our understanding of dis/ability issues within education, and by
          extension, society.

          <ul>
            <li>Be introduced to, or extend their knowledge of, a dis/ability studies perspective.</li>
            <li>Explore various ways of understanding dis/ability (medical model, social model, charity model, civil rights model, etc.).</li>
            <li>Explain the value of understanding school and classroom practices through a DSE (Disability Studies in Education) lens.</li>
            <li>Examine the history of schooling for students with and without dis/abilities.</li>
            <li>Describe the differences between traditional special education and a DSE approach to understanding dis/ability.</li>
            <li>Debate the validity and/or usefulness of dis/ability categories that have been constructed within the education field, such as “learning disabilities” and “emotional disturbance.”</li>
            <li>Analyze complex issues involved in inclusive education.</li>
            <li>Discuss negative social perceptions, ableism, stigma, and discrimination experienced by people with dis/abilities within an education context.</li>
            <li>Explain discrepancies in educational opportunities when dis/ability intersects with race, class, and gender.</li>
            <li>Evaluate the experience(s) of dis/ability for urban students.</li>
            <li>Consider schools as work environments for educators with dis/abilities.</li>
            <li>Discuss ways to advocate for, and with, students with dis/abilities and their parents.</li>
            <li>Apply critical thinking skills to examine issues related to disability policy and law.</li>

        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>
          I believe that this course allowed me to utilize a disability studies lens to citically analyze education. I am grateful for how we utilized the different models to shape our perspectives and focus on disability in academia. It has given me fuel to be an advocate for inclusive education and has deepened my understanding of how systemic inequities impact both students and educators with disabilities.

        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>
          This course helped to deepen my understanding of how aging impacts people, particularly how it typically ends up pushing people to identify as having a disability themselves. I was also glad to learn about the shift from institutionalization to community-based supports and how important inclusive,person-centered care is. I believe I am capable of being a better advocate when it comes to considering emerging services and it reinforced the importance of innovative, compassionate approaches to improve the quality of life for people with disabilities.
