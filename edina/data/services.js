        <h4>Course Description</h4>
        <p>
          This course focuses on issues related to embodiment and the biological and medical aspects of
          disability. Students who complete the course will be knowledgeable about: the relationship
          between Disability Studies, medical sociology and the concept of the “lived body;” the difference
          between an understanding of the disabled body as a social construction and as a medical problem;
          the health care needs and experiences of people with disabilities; public policies related to the
          access of people with disabilities to quality health care; identification, prevalence, clinical
          manifestations, cognitive, behavioral and social implications and interventions associated with
          genetic causes of disabilities and acquired disabilities due to traumatic events; the relationship of
          Disability Studies and bioethics in areas such as prenatal testing, the genome project and assisted
          suicide; the value and possibilities of non-verbal communication and sign language to improve the
          quality of life of people with sensory disabilities; language development and educational options
          for children with cochlear implants; modes of communication with individuals with hearing
          impairments and other sensory disabilities; advances in our understanding of issues related to the
          sexual life of people with disabilities; the value of universal design and the physical accessibility of the built environment to people with disabilities and the broader community; and the potential
          for assistive technologies to improve the quality of life of persons with impairments and
          disabilities.
        </p>
        <h4>Program Goals & Assignments</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Explore and articulate the difference between an understanding of the disabled body as a social construction, as a medical problem, and as a lived experience.</li>
          <li>Understand and analyze public policies related to disabled bodies, the variety of embodied experiences of disability, the relationship of disability studies to bioethics, embodied communication, intersectionality, and disabled sexuality.</li>
          <li>Identify, analyze, and critique problems in accommodation and assistance, universal design, and communication access.</li>
          <li>Describe the impact and implications on embodiment on disability studies as a field.</li>
          <li>Demonstrate progressive facility in critical reading, comparison and analysis.</li>
          <li>Build confidence and skill in responding to discussion questions.</li>
        </ul>
        <br></br>
        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>
          This course was eye opening as it provided me with a deeper understanding of how disability is shaped by a combination of social constructs, bodies, minds, and lived experiences. I thoroughly enjoyed materials and discussions regarding the &quot;lived body&quot; and how we connected theory to the real world experiences of people with disabilities. It was also interesting to learn about how assistive technologies and communication strategies could increase the quality of life for individuals with sensory disabilities.

      <>
        <h4>Course Description</h4>
        <p>
          This course will examine the rights and protections afforded to people with disabilities in different arenas. By studying a brief history
          of the disability rights movement and the structure of the American legal system, you will gain an understanding of some of the
          federal laws which have made discrimination against people with disabilities illegal. This course will primarily focus on those
          protections in the areas of employment, public accommodations, federally funded programs, and education. The key laws we will
          study this semester include: (1) Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; (2) the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA); and
          (3) the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). You will learn how these laws were created and what they purport to do,
          how the United States Supreme Court has interpreted these laws, and how these laws are being enforced in our communities. We will
          also spend a class discussing international law, specifically the ADA’s influence on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of
          Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD). Most importantly, you will learn how to apply these laws in order to spot disability rights
          issues in your communities and learn more about advocacy in these areas.
        </p>
        <h4>Program Goals & Assignments</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Apply critical thinking skills to examine issues related to disability policy and law.</li>
          <li>Advocate for improved quality of life and social justice for people with disabilities.</li>
        </ul>

        <br></br>
        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>
          This course provided a comprehensive layout of materials and discussions that ultimately helped me to understand the legal protections of people with disabilities and how those lawas have shaped accessibility and equity. I really enjoyed learning about how to interpret the ADA, section 504, and how the Supreme Court descisions have influenced their implementation. I feel more confident in identifying legal violations and discussion rationale for why certain laws have been put in place.

        <h4>Course Description</h4>
        <p>
          This course will provide an introduction to disability studies and the humanities. Over the last 25
          years disability scholars have analyzed representations of people with disabilities as they appear
          in literature, myth, art, film, photography, dance, and theater. These fields reflect and shape the
          meaning and reality of disability. Poetic and other artistic modes of discourse can deepen our
          understanding of the lived experience of disability. However, these shared representations of
          disability are, for the most part, them for granted. Yet they have a powerful effect on the popular
          culture and the attitudes and behaviors of individuals.
        </p>
        <h4>Program Goals & Assignments</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Knowledge of Disability Experience, Individual or Societal</li>
          <li>Dedication to Improvement of Quality of Life for Individuals with Disabilities</li>
        </ul>
        <br></br>
        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>
          This course improved my understanding of how disability is represented and interpreted in various kinds of mediums. Engaging with all of these texts have given us insight into the symbolic roles disability has been assigned such as punishment or inspiration and how these portrays may shape public perception. I think it was important that we learned to apply disability studies theory to art/literature so that we could move beyong surface-level critiques and recognize the societal impact that these narratives have on people with disabilities. I feel more equipped to talk about and analyze different works through a disability studies lens.

        <p>
          This is a graduate course that focuses on a variety of topics, specifically addressing medical and
          behavioral interventions which include program options and challenges to support people with
          disabilities as they age. The course will highlight best practices in the field, as well as
          innovations and approaches to extend the quality of life for people with disabilities who are
          elderly and facing unique challenges as they age.
        </p>
        <h4>Program Goals & Assignments</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Describe how the aging process affects people with disabilities in unique ways.</li>
          <li>Describe dementia; differentiating dementia from aging, memory loss, and Alzheimer&apos;s.</li>
          <li>Discuss how dementia affects people with disabilities.</li>
          <li>Describe the medical histories of people with disabilities having factors related to fostering dementia and aging.</li>
          <li>Analyze the history of services and supports for people with disabilities as they age, including long-term institutionalization vs. community-based support systems.</li>
          <li>Discuss emerging medical supports for people with disabilities as they age.</li>
          <li>Differentiate services and supports for aging people with disabilities in the community using critical thinking skills.</li>
        </ul>

        <br></br>
        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>
          This course helped to deepen my understanding of how aging impacts people, particularly how it typically ends up pushing people to identify as having a disability themselves. I was also glad to learn about the shift from institutionalization to community-based supports and how important inclusive,person-centered care is. I believe I am capable of being a better advocate when it comes to considering emerging services and it reinforced the importance of innovative, compassionate approaches to improve the quality of life for people with disabilities.
